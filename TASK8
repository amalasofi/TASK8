List down all the error types and check all the errors using a python program for all errors

types of error
  Syntax error, Logical error or Exceptions
for  syntax error
if 5< 3
  File "<interactive input>"
    if 5 < 3
for exceptions
15+spam*3 = name error
100*(1/0) = zero division error
'4'+4= type error

Design a simple calculator app with try and except for all use cases
try:
    c=a+b
    d=a-b
    e=a*b
    f=a/b
    print(c,d,e,f)
except:
    print("no")
    
print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors
try:
    print(doctor)
except NameError:
    print("doctor is not defined")
    
try:
    print("engineer")
except TypeError:
    print("engineer is not defined")
except:
    print("end of the code")
    
When try-except scenario is not required?
   The reson for use try and except is when we have the code block that will sometimes run correctly and sometimes not , depending on conditions.so when we doesn't have code block try-except scenario is not required.


Try getting an input inside the try catch block
try:
    print(num)
except:
    print("progrom is ended")
num=int(input('Enter the num:'))
if num>0:
    print('num is positive')
else:
    print('num is negative')
    
OUTPUT:
no
doctor is not defined
engineer
progrom is ended
Enter the num:5
num is positive
